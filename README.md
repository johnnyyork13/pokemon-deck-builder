# Pokémon Deck Builder

## This application allows the user to add Pokémon cards virtually via the localStorage and PokemonTCG.io API's. 

To add cards, simply reference the cards set ID on the card's bottom corner, as well as the associated emblem. Then, find the emblem in the provided list in the application's sidebar. Once the emblem has been found,  type the set ID in below and click the search button. After the card loads, the user is able to review the card's stats and is given the option to add the card to their deck.

The deck features many sorting options, like card type, value, strength, HP, and evolutions. This allows the user to prioritize favorable statistics to build a strong deck. When a card is no longer needed, the delete option may be used via hovering over the card.

## This project was developed for the sole purpose of practicing the React framework and sorting/handling API data. It was built entirely with React and vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
